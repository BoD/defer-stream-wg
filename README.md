# GraphQL defer/stream Working Group

This repo is used by the individuals working on the GraphQL defer/stream spec proposal and the Incremental Delivery GraphQL-over-http proposal. GitHub discussions will be used to document architectural decisions made by this group and to gather feedback and discussions on this proposal.

## New to defer/stream?
The easiest way to learn about the defer/stream directives is to [read the RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md).
